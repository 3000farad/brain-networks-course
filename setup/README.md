### Environment setup for Brain Networks course

For this course we will use a virtual machine that will allow everyone to have
an identical environment regardless of their operating system. You are of course
free to install all of the dependencies on your own system, but they are not
guaranteed to work (and some will certainly not work if you are on Windows).

To use the VM:

1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

3. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/) if you don't already have it.

4. Clone the repository onto your computer:

```git clone https://github.com/poldrack/brain-networks-course.git```

5. Go into the repo directory and run the following command to provision the
virtual machine (this will take a little while and involves lots of downloading,
  so be sure to do it from a good network).
